# India-CPI-Inflation-Case-Study-using-MS-Excel
End-to-end data analytics case study analyzing India’s CPI inflation using MS Excel. Includes data preparation, data hygiene checks, time-series trend analysis, category-wise inflation insights, and correlation with crude oil price fluctuations to identify key inflation drivers.
Project Overview

This project analyzes India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation trends using Microsoft Excel.
The CPI is a key measure of inflation that reflects changes in the price levels of goods and services commonly consumed by households.

This case study focuses on understanding sector-wise inflation dynamics, COVID-19’s economic impact, and the correlation of imported crude oil prices with various CPI categories across Rural, Urban, and Combined sectors.
Objectives

To understand CPI inflation patterns in India from 2017–2023.

To identify category-wise contributors to inflation.

To analyze food price trends and their volatility.

To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inflation behavior.

To assess how global crude oil price fluctuations influence domestic inflation.

Key Analysis & Insights
Analysis Question	Key Insights
Q1. Inflation Trend Overview	CPI data shows a steady rise in inflation post-2017, driven largely by food and fuel categories.
Q2. YoY Inflation (2017–2023)	2019 recorded the highest CPI inflation (7.7%), mainly due to a 65% spike in vegetable prices. Inflation moderated post-2021 but remained above 5%.
Q3. Food Inflation (Jun 2022–May 2023)	Spices category showed the highest inflation contribution across Rural, Urban, and Combined sectors. Oils & Fats and Vegetables declined due to global commodity correction.
Q4. COVID-19 Impact (Pre vs Post Mar 2020)	Post-pandemic inflation was driven by Healthcare (+10–15%), Food, and Essential Services. The period marked a shift toward essential consumption inflation.
Q5. Imported Oil Price Correlation (2021–2023)	Strong correlation (r ≥ 0.7) observed between Oil Prices and Fuel & Light, Transport, and Food & Beverages categories, confirming energy price pass-through into rural inflation.
