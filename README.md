Indai CPI Inflation Case Study

This project analyzes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in India to understand inflation patterns, key contributing categories, and the effects of major economic and global events. 
The study uses Excel-based data analysis to identify category-wise contributions, year-on-year (YoY) and month-on-month (MoM) inflation trends, 
and correlations between price changes and external factors like crude oil prices.
